> The study of ecological networks is severely limited by (i) the difficulty
to access data, (ii) the lack of a standardized way to link meta-data with
interactions, and (iii) the disparity of formats in which ecological networks
themselves are represented. To overcome these limitations, we conceived
a data specification for ecological networks. We implemented a database
respecting this standard, and released a R package ( `rmangal`) allowing
users to programmatically access, curate, and deposit data on ecological
interactions. In this article, we show how these tools, in conjunctions
with other frameworks for the programmatic manipulation of open ecological
data, streamlines the analysis process, and improves eplicability and
reproducibility of ecological networks studies.

# Introduction

Ecological networks enable ecologists to accommodate the complexity
of natural communities, and to discover mechanisms contributing to
their persistence, stability, resilience, and functioning. Most of the
"early" studies of ecological networks were focused on understanding
how the structure of interactions within one location affected the
ecological properties of this local community. Such analyses revealed the
contribution of 'average' network properties, such as the buffering impact
of modularity on species loss [@pimm_food_1991, @yodzis_stability_1981],
the increase in robustness to extinctions along with increases in
connectance [@dunne_network_2002], and the fact that organization of
interactions maximizes biodiversity [@bastolla_architecture_2009]. More
recently, new studies introduced the idea that networks can vary from
one realization to another. They can be meaningfully compared, either to
understand the importance of environmental gradients on the realization
of ecological interactions [@tylianakis_habitat_2007], or to understand
the mechanisms behind variation in the structure of ecological networks
[@poisot_dissimilarity_2012]. Yet, meta-analyses of a large number of
ecological networks are still extremely rare, and most of the studies
comparing several networks do so within the limit of particular systems
[@schleuning_specialization_2011;@dalsgaard_historical_2013]. The severe
shortage of data in the field also restricts the scope of large-scale analyses.

An increasing number of approaches are being put forth to *predict* the
structure of ecological networks, either relying on latent variables
[@rohr_modeling_2010] or actual traits [@gravel_inferring_2013]. Such
approaches, so as to be adequately calibrated, require easily accessible
data. Comparing the efficiency of different methods is also facilitated
if there is an homogeneous way of representing ecological interactions,
and the associated metadata. In this paper, we (i) establish the need of a
data specification serving as a *lingua franca* among network ecologists,
(ii) describe this data specification, and (iii) describe `rmangal`, a
`R` package and companion database relying on this data specification. The
`rmangal` package allows to easily retrieve, but also deposit, ecological
interaction networks data from a database. We provide some use cases showing
how this new approach makes complex analyzes simpler, and allows for the
integration of new tools to manipulate biodiversity resources.

# Networks need a data specification

Ecological networks are (often) stored as an *adjacency matrix* (or as
the quantitative link matrix), that is a series of `0` and `1` indicating,
respectively, the absence and presence of an interaction. This format is
extremely convenient for *use* (as most network analysis packages, *e.g.*
`bipartite`, `betalink`, `foodweb`, require data to be presented this way),
but is extremely inefficient at *storing* meta-data. In most cases, an
adjacency matrix informs on the identity of species (in cases where rows and
columns headers are present), and the presence or absence of interactions. If
other data about the environment (*e.g.* where the network was sampled)
or the species (*e.g.* the population size, trait distribution, or other
observations) are available, they are most either given in other files,
or as accompanying text. In both cases, making a programmatic link between
interaction data and relevant meta-data is difficult and error-prone.

By contrast, a data specification (*i.e.* a set of precise instructions
detailing how each object should be represented) provides a common language
for network ecologists to interact, and ensure that, regardless of their
source, data can be used in a shared workflow. Most importantly, a data
specification describes how data are *exchanged*. Each group retains the
ability to store the data in the format that is most convenient for in-house
use, and only needs to provide export options (*e.g.* through an API, *i.e.*
a programmatic interface running on a webserver, returning data in  response to
queries in a pre-determined language) respecting the data specification. This
approach ensures that *all* data can be used in meta-analyses, and increases
the impact of data [@piwowar_data_2013;@piwowar_sharing_2007].

# Elements of the data specification

The data specification (Fig. 1) is built around the idea that (ecological)
networks are collections of relationships between ecological objects, each
element having particular meta-data associated. In this section, we detail the
way networks are represented in the `mangal` specification. An interactive
webpage with the elements of the data specification can be found online at
`http://mangal.uqar.ca./doc/spec/`. The data specification is available
either at the API root (*e.g.* `http://mangal.uqar.ca/api/v1/?format=json`),
or can be viewed using the `whatIs` function from the `R` package
(see *Supp. Mat. 1*). Rather than giving an exhaustive list of the data
specification (which is available online at the aforementioned URL), this
section serves as an overview of each element, and how they interact.

![An overview of the data specification, and the hierarchy between objects. Each box correspond to a level of the data specification. Grey boxes are nodes, blue boxes are interactions and networks, and green boxes are metadata. The **bold** boxes (`dataset`, `network`, `interaction`, `taxa`) are the minimal elements needed to represent a network.](figure-dataspec.pdf)

We propose `JSON`, a format equivalent to `XML`, as an efficient way to
uniformise data representation for two main reasons. First, it has emerged
as a *de facto* standard for web platform serving data, and accepting data
from users. Second, it allows *validation* of the data: a `JSON` file can be
matched against a scheme, and one can verify that it is correctly formatted
(this includes the possibility that not all fields are filled, as will
depend on available data). Finally, `JSON` objects are easily and cheaply
(memory-wise) parsed in the most common programming languages, notably `R`
(equivalent to `list`) and `python` (equivalent to `dict`). For most users,
the format in which data are transmitted is unimportant, as the interaction
happens within `R` -- as such, knowing how `JSON` objects are organized
is only useful for those who want to interact with the API directly. The
`rmangal` package takes care of converting the data into the correct `JSON`
format to upload them in the database.

## Node information

### Taxa

Taxa are a taxonomic entity of any level, identified by their name,
vernacular name, and their identifiers in a variety of taxonomic
services. Associating the identifiers of each taxa is important to leverage
the power of the new generation of open data tools, such as `taxize`
[@chamberlain_taxize:_2013]. The data specification currently has fields
for `ncbi`, `gbif`, `itis`, `eol` and `bold` identifiers. We also provide
the taxonomic status, *i.e.* whether a taxa is a true taxonomic entity, a
"trophic species", or a morphospecies.

### Population

A `population` is one observed instance of a `taxa` object. If your
experimental design is replicated through space, then each taxa have a
`population` object corresponding to each locality. Populations do not have
associated meta-data, but serve as "containers" for `item` objects.

### Item

An `item` is an instance of a population. Items have a `level` argument,
which can be  either `individual` or `population`; this allows to represent
both individual-level networks (*i.e.* there are as many `item`s attached to
a `population` than there were individuals of this `population` sampled),
and population-level networks. When `item` represents a population, it is
possible to give a measure of the size of this population. The notion of
`item` is particularly useful for time-replicated designs: each observation
of a population at a time-point is an `item` with associated `trait` values,
and possibly population size.

## Network information

### Interaction

An `interaction` links, *a minima*, two `taxa` objects (but can also link pairs
of `population`s or `item`s). The most important attributes of `interaction`s
are the type of interaction (of which we provide a list of possible values,
see *Supp. Mat. 1*), and its `nature`, *i.e.* how it was observed. This field
help differentiate direct observations, text mining, and inference. Note
that the `nature` field can also take `absence` as a value; this is useful
for, *e.g.*, "cafeteria" experiments in which there is high confidence that
the interaction did not happen.

### Network

A `network` is a series of `interaction` object, along with (i) informations
on its spatial position (provided at the latitude and longitude), (ii) the
date of sampling, and (iii) references to measures of environmental conditions. 

### Dataset

A `dataset` is a collection of one or several `network`(s). Datasets also have
a field for `data` and `papers`, both of which are references to bibliographic
or web resources describing, respectively, the source of the data, and the
papers in which these data have been significantly used. Datasets are the
preferred entry point in the resources.

## Meta-data

### Trait value

Objects of type `item` can have associated `trait` values. These consist
in the description of the trait being measured, the value, and the units in
which the measure was taken.

### Environmental condition

Environmental conditions are associated to datasets, networks, and interactions
objects, to allow for both macro and micro environmental conditions. These
are defined by the environmental property measured, its value, and the units.

### References

References are associated to datasets. They accommodate the DOI, JSON or
PubMed identifiers, or a URL. When possible, the DOI should be preferred as
it offers more potential to interact with other on-line tools, such as the
*CrossRef* API.

# Use cases

In this section, we present use cases using the `rmangal` package for `R`,
to interact with a database implementing this data specification, and serving
data through an API (`http://mangal.uqar.ca/api/v1/`). It is possible for users
to deposit data into this database, through the `R` package. Data are made
available under a *CC-0 Waiver* [@poisot_moving_2013]. Detailed informations
about how to upload data are given in the vignettes and manual of the `rmangal`
package. So as to save room in the manuscript, we source each example; the
complete `r` files to reproduce the examples of this section are attached
as *Suppl. Mat.*. In addition, the `rmangal` package comes with vignettes
explaining how users can upload their data into the database, through `R`.

The data we use for this example come from @ricciardi_assemblage_2010. These
were previously available on the *InteractionWeb DataBase* as a
single `xls` file. We uploaded them in the `mangal` database at
`http://mangal.uqar.ca/api/v1/dataset/1`.

## Link-species relationships

In the first example, we visualize the relationship between the number of
species and the number of interactions, which @martinez_constant_1992 propose
to be linear (in food webs).

```{r getLS, fig.cap = "Relationship between the number of species and number of interactions in the anemonefish-fish dataset.", dev='pdf', results='asis'}
source('usecases/1_ls.r')
```

Producing this figure requires less than 10 lines of code. The only information
needed is the identifier of the network or dataset, which we suggest should
be reported in publications as: "These data were deposited in the `mangal`
format at `<URL>/api/v1/dataset/<ID>`", possibly in the acknowledgements. So
as to encourage data sharing, we encourage users of the database to cite
the original dataset or publication.

## Network beta-diversity

In the second example, we use the framework of network $\beta$-diversity
[@poisot_dissimilarity_2012] to measure the extent to which networks that are
far apart in space have different interactions. Each network in the dataset
has a latitude and longitude, meaning that it is possible to measure the
geographic distance between two networks.

For each pair of network, we measure the geographic distance (in km.),
the species dissimilarity ($\beta_S$), the network dissimilarity when all
species are present ($\beta_{WN}$), and finally, the network dissimilarity
when only shared species are considered ($\beta_{OS}$).

```{r useBeta, fig.cap="Relationships between the geographic distance between two sites, and the species dissimilarity, network dissimilarity with all, and only shared, species.", dev='pdf', message=FALSE}
source('usecases/2_beta.r')
```

As shown in *Fig. XX*, while species dissimilarity and overall network
dissimilarity increase when two networks are far apart, this is not the case
for the way common species interact. This suggests that in this system, network
dissimilarity over space is primarily driven by species turnover. The ease
to gather both raw interaction data and associated meta-data make producing
this analysis extremely straightforward.

## Spatial visualization of networks

@bascompte_disentangling_2009 uses an interesting visualization for
spatial networks, in which each species is laid out on a map at the
center of mass of its distribution; interactions are then drawn between
species to show how species distribution determines biotic interactions. In
this final use case, we propose to reproduce a similar figure.

```{r useSpace, fig.cap="Spatial plot of a network, using the `maps` and `rmangal` packages. The circle in the inset map show the location of the sites. Each dot in the main map represents a species, with interactions drawn between them.", dev='pdf', message=FALSE}
source('usecases/3_spatial.r')
```
# Conclusions

In this contribution, we presented `mangal`, a data format for the
exchange of ecological networks and associated meta-data. We deployed
an online database with an associated API, relying on this data
specification. Finally, we introduced `rmangal`, a `R` package designed
to interact with APIs using the `mangal` format. We expect that the data
specification will evolve based on the needs of the community. At the
moment, users are welcome to propose such changes on the project issue page:
<https://github.com/mangal-wg/mangal-schemes/issues>. A `python` wrapper
for the API is also available at <http://github.com/mangal-wg/pymangal/>.
