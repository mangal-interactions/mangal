> The study of ecological networks is severely limited by (i) the difficulty
to access data, (ii) the lack of a standardized way to link meta-data with
interactions, and (iii) the disparity of formats in which ecological networks
themselves are represented. To overcome these limitations, we conceived
a data specification for ecological networks. We implemented a database
respecting this standard, and released a R package ( `rmangal`) allowing
users to programmatically access, curate, and deposit data on ecological
interactions. In this article, we show how these tools, in conjunctions
with other frameworks for the programmatic manipulation of open ecological
data, streamlines the analysis process, and improves replicability and
reproducibility of ecological networks studies.

# Introduction

Ecological networks enable ecologists to accommodate the complexity of natural
communities, and to discover mechanisms contributing to their persistence,
stability, resilience, and functioning. Most of the "early" studies of
ecological networks were focused on understanding how the structure of
interactions within one location affected the ecological properties of this
local community. Such analyses revealed the contribution of 'average' network properties, such as the buffering impact
of modularity on species loss [@stouffer_compartmentalization_2011], the
increase in robustness to extinctions along with increases in connectance
[@dunne_network_2002], and the fact that organization of interactions
maximize biodiversity [@bastolla_architecture_2009]. More recently, new
studies introduced the idea that networks can vary from one realization to another. They can be meaningfully
compared, either to understand the importance of environmental gradients on
the realization of ecological interactions [@tylianakis_habitat_2007], or
to understand the mechanisms behind variation in the structure of ecological
networks [@poisot_dissimilarity_2012]. Yet, meta-analyses of a large number
of ecological networks are still extremely rare, and most of the studies
comparing several networks do so within the limit of particular systems
[@schleuning_specialization_2011;@dalsgaard_historical_2013]. In part,
this can be attributed to the limited methods allowing to compare networks
in which no species are in common. However, the severe shortage of data in
the field also restricts the scope of large-scale analyses.

An increasing number of approaches are being put forth to *predict* the
structure of ecological networks, either relying on latent variables
[@rohr_modeling_2010] or actual traits [@gravel_inferring_2013]. Such
approaches, so as to be adequately calibrated, require easily accessible
data. Comparing the efficiency of different methods is also facilitated
if there is an homogeneous way of representing ecological interactions,
and the associated metadata. In this paper, we (i) establish the need of a
data specification serving as a *lingua franca* among network ecologists,
(ii) describe this data specification. Finally, we (iii) describe `rmangal`,
a `R` package and companion database relying on this data specification. We
provide some use cases showing how this new approach makes complex analyzes
simpler, and allows for the integration of new tools to manipulate biodiversity
resources.

# Networks need a data specification

Ecological networks are (often) stored as an *adjacency matrix* (or as
the quantitative link matrix), that is a series of `0` and `1` indicating,
respectively, the absence and presence of an interaction. This format is
extremely convenient for *use* (as most network analysis packages, *e.g.*
`bipartite`, `betalink`, `foodweb`, require data to be presented this way),
but is extremely inefficient at *storing* meta-data. In most cases, an
adjacency matrix informs on the identity of species (in cases where
rows and columns headers are present), and the presence or absence of
interactions. If other data about the environment (*e.g.* where the network
was sampled) or the species (*e.g.* the population size, trait distribution,
or other observations) are available, they are most either given in other
files, or as accompanying text. In both cases, making a programmatic link
between interaction data and relevant meta-data is difficult and error-prone.

%DG: you need to define what is data specification. It is a precise terminology which is likely to be unknown by most readers

By contrast, a data specification provides a common language for network
ecologists to interact, and ensure that, regardless of their source, data
can be used in a shared workflow. Most importantly, a data specification
describes how data are *exchanged*. Each group retains the ability to
store the data in the format that is most convenient for in-house use,
and only needs to provide export options (*e.g.* through an API, that is
a programmatic interface returning objects in response to pre-determined
requests) respecting the data specification. This approach ensures that
*all* data can be used in meta-analyses, and increases the impact of data
[@piwowar_data_2013;@piwowar_sharing_2007].

# Elements of the data specification

%DG: even though it might be obvious to a lot of people, you have to think about students or old farts who don't know what is an API or what it does. You should describe it at some point before referring to it. Not only the API, but also the motivation underlying it's usage instead of someone storing a bunch of excel or .txt files on his hard drive. 

The data specification (Fig. **XX**) is built around the idea that
(ecological) networks are collections of relationships between ecological
objects, each element having particular meta-data associated. In this
section, we detail the way networks are represented in the
`mangal` specification. An interactive webpage with the elements of the data
specification can be found online at `http://mangal.uqar.ca./doc/spec/`. The
data specification is available either at the API root (*e.g.*
`http://mangal.uqar.ca/api/v1/?format=json`), or can be viewed using the
`whatIs` function from the `R` package (see *Supp. Mat. 1*). Rather than
giving an exhaustive list of the data specification (which is available
online at the aforementionned URL), this section serves as an overview of
each element, and how they interact.

![An overview of the data specification, and the hierarchy between objects. Each box correspond to a level of the data specification. Grey boxes are nodes, blue boxes are interactions and networks, and green boxes are metadata. The **bold** boxes (`dataset`, `network`, `interaction`, `taxa`) are the minimal elements needed to represent a network.](figure-dataspec.pdf)
%DG: the bold does not appear great. Should find another way to represent the info, either with underline, italics, colour, form etc…

We propose `JSON`, a format equivalent to `XML`, as an efficient way to
uniformise data representation for two main reasons. First, it has emerged
as a *de facto* standard for web platform serving data, and accepting data
from users. Second, it allows *validation* of the data: a `JSON` file can be
matched against a scheme, and one can verify that it is correctly formatted
(this includes the possibility that not all fields are filled, as will
depend on available data). Finally, `JSON` objects are easily and cheaply
(memory-wise) parsed in the most common programming languages, notably `R`
(equivalent to `list`) and `python` (equivalent to `dict`). For most users,
the format in which data are transmitted is unimportant, as the interaction
happens within `R` -- as such, knowing how `JSON` objects are organized is
only useful for those who want to interact with the API directly.

## Node information

### Taxa

Taxa are a taxonomic entity of any level, identified by their name,
vernacular name, and their identifiers in a variety of taxonomic
services. Associating the identifiers of each taxa is important to leverage
the power of the new generation of open data tools, such as `taxize`
[@chamberlain_taxize:_2013]. The data specification currently has fields for
`ncbi`, `gbif`, `itis`, `eol` and `bold` identifiers.

%DG: it appears to me that many people won't be able to fill all fields. You should make an explicit statement about missing data somewhere

### Population

A `population` is one observed instance of a `taxa` object. If your
experimental design is replicated through space, then each taxa have a
`population` object corresponding to each locality. Populations do not have
associated meta-data, but serve as "containers" for `item` objects.

### Item

An `item` is an instance of a population. Items have a `level` argument,
which can be  either `individual` or `population`; this allows to represent
both individual-level networks (*i.e.* there are as many `item`s attached to
a `population` than there were individuals of this `population` sampled),
and population-level networks. When `item` represents a population, it is
possible to give a measure of the size of this population. The notion of
`item` is particularly useful for time-replicated designs: each observation
of a population at a time-point is an `item` with associated `trait` values,
and possibly population size.

## Network information

### Interaction

An `interaction` links, *a minima*, two `taxa` objects (but can also link pairs
of `population`s or `item`s). The most important attributes of `interaction`s
are the type of interaction (of which we provide a list of possible values,
see *Supp. Mat. 1*), and its `nature`, *i.e.* how it was observed. This field
help differentiate direct observations, text mining, and inference. Note
that the `nature` field can also take `absence` as a value; this is useful
for, *e.g.*, "cafeteria" experiments in which there is high confidence that
the interaction did not happen.

### Network

A `network` is a series of `interaction` object, along with (i) informations
on its spatial position (provided at the latitude and longitude), (ii) the
date of sampling, and (iii) references to measures of environmental conditions. 

### Dataset

A `dataset` is a collection of one or several `network`(s). Datasets also have
a field for `data` and `papers`, both of which are references to bibliographic
or web resources describing, respectively, the source of the data, and the
papers in which these data have been significantly used. Datasets are the
preferred entry point in the resources.

## Meta-data

### Trait value

Objects of type `item` can have associated `trait` values. These consist
in the description of the trait being measured, the value, and the units in
which the measure was taken.

### Environmental condition

Environmental conditions are associated to network. These are defined by
the environmental property measured, its value, and the units.
%DG: hummm…. not sure it is appropriate. Isn't an item object? It will be rare, but sometimes you can have individual level information on the environment. For instance, in Renaud's analysis, every individual tree will belong to an experimental treatment. 

### References

References are associated to datasets. They accommodate the DOI, JSON or
PubMed identifiers, or a URL. When possible, the DOI should be preferred as
it offers more potential to interact with other on-line tools, such as the
*CrossRef* API.

# Use cases

In this section, we present use cases using the `rmangal` package for `R`,
to interact with a database implementing this data specification, and serving
data through an API (`http://mangal.uqar.ca/api/v1/`). It is possible
for users to deposit data into this database, through the `R` package. Data
are made available under a *CC-0 Waiver* [@poisot_moving_2013]. Detailed
informations about how to upload data are given in the vignettes and manual
of the `rmangal` package. So as to save room in the manuscript, we source
each example; the complete `r` files to reproduce the examples of this
section are attached as *Suppl. Mat.*.

The data we use for this example come from @ricciardi_assemblage_2010. These
were previously available on the *InteractionWeb DataBase* as a
single `xls` file. We uploaded them in the `mangal` database at
`http://mangal.uqar.ca/api/v1/dataset/{todo}`.

## Link-species relationships

In the first example, we visualize the relationship between the number of
species and the number of interactions, which @martinez_constant_1992 propose
to be linear (in food webs).

```{r getLS, fig.cap = "Relationship between the number of species and number of interactions in the anemonefish-fish dataset.", dev='pdf', results='asis'}
source('usecases/1_ls.r')
```

Producing this figure requires less than 10 lines of code. The only information
needed is the identifier of the network or dataset, which we suggest should
be reported in publications as: "These data were deposited in the `mangal`
format at `<URL>/api/v1/dataset/<ID>`". This encourages data re-use.
%DG: should you specify at some point how to provide appropriate references to the original databases? I am just concerned that the actual paper will receive all the credits for the data use, but not the original studies.

%DG: another point of discussion I remember I had with Nico. At some point, he was suggesting that a meta database should have a field for the data quality. I am not convinced about it because a dataset could be of high quality for one purpose and crapy for another one. But still, it was a point he had some concerns and thus should deserve a minimal consideration.  


## Network beta-diversity

In the second example, we use the framework of network $\beta$-diversity
[@poisot_dissimilarity_2012] to measure the extent to which networks that are
far apart in space have different interactions. Each network in the dataset
has a latitude and longitude, meaning that it is possible to measure the
geographic distance between two networks.

For each pair of network, we measure the geographic distance (in km.),
the species dissimilarity ($\beta_S$), the network dissimilarity when all
species are present ($\beta_{WN}$), and finally, the network dissimilarity
when only shared species are considered ($\beta_{OS}$).

```{r useBeta, fig.cap="Relationships between the geographic distance between two sites, and the species dissimilarity, network dissimilarity with all, and only shared, species.", dev='pdf', message=FALSE}
source('usecases/2_beta.r')
```

As shown in *Fig. XX*, while species dissimilarity and overall network
dissimilarity increase when two networks are far apart, this is not the case
for the way common species interact. This suggests that in this system, network
dissimilarity over space is primarily driven by species turnover. The ease
to gather both raw interaction data and associated meta-data make producing
this analysis extremely straightforward.

## Spatial visualization of networks

@bascompte_disentangling_2009 uses an interesting visualization for
spatialized networks, in which each species is laid out on a map at the
center of mass of its distribution; interactions are then drawn between
species to show how species distribution determines biotic interactions. In
this final use case, we propose to reproduce a similar figure, using the
`RgoogleMaps` package.

```{r useSpace, fig.cap="Spatial plot of a network, using the `maps` and `rmangal` packages. The circle in the inset map show the location of the sites. Each dot in the main map represents a species, with interactions drawn between them.", dev='pdf', message=FALSE}
source('usecases/3_spatial.r')
```
# Conclusions

In this contribution, we presented `mangal`, a data format for the exchange of
ecological networks and associated meta-data. We deployed an online database
with an associated API, relying on this data specification. Finally, we
introduced `rmangal`, a `R` package designed to interact with APIs using the
`mangal` format. We expect that the data specification will evolve based on
the needs of the community. At the moment, users are welcome to propose such
changes on the project issue page: <https://github.com/mangal-wg/mangal/issues>.
